# ðŸ“‘ How to Use
- Download all of the files (using the web zip format or by cloning the repo).
- Open the directory of the MaNGOS core that you are using (MaNGOS1).
- Copy/move the "MaNGOS_Model_Viewer" directory into your Interface/Addons/ directory in your client.

# ðŸ’» Scripts
I've included a "Scripts" directory, this is NOT required for using the addon. It's a quick script that I used to build m#data.lua.
More information can be found inside of the script.
